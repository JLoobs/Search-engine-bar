# Search-engine-bar

The motivation behind creating this project was to build a visually appealing and functional search bar web application. I wanted to combine my interest in front-end development with the practicality of a search utility, creating an accessible tool that users can enjoy using.


I built this project as a way to improve my HTML and CSS skills while creating a tangible and useful application. The search bar is a fundamental element of the web, and I wanted to explore how to design and implement it with a modern and elegant touch.


The project solves the common need for a user-friendly search interface. It offers a stylish search bar that blends seamlessly into various website designs. Users can quickly input their search queries and initiate searches, enhancing their browsing experience.


Through building this project, I gained valuable insights into:

I learned how to create visually engaging interfaces using CSS, including flexbox layout, background styling, and button design.
Form Handling: I gained experience in setting up HTML forms and handling user input, improving my understanding of form elements and their attributes.
Visual Effects: I explored techniques like backdrop filtering to achieve a modern aesthetic, enhancing the overall user experience.
